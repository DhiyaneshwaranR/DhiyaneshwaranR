# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Esh

##  About Me

I turn complex problems into elegant distributed systems, one microservice at a time. With 7+ years of breaking monoliths (and occasionally prod), I've learned that every problem is just a well-designed system waiting to happen. MSc in Entrepreneurship , but my real degree is in Making Things Workâ„¢.

##  What I do

>Professional problem solver: If it can't scale, is it even worth deploying?

>Turning 'it works on my machine' into 'it works in production' since 2016

>Crafting distributed systems by day, contemplating the perfect database schema by night - Because every problem is just a well-designed system waiting to happen
